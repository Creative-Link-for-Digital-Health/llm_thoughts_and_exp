## Benchmarking

## Micro-constitution
Need to figure out issues such as enduser autonomy for behavior change agents that we are working on. Too easy to create a nagging bot or overstep some important ethical boundaries. Might be addressed via prompt or through the trainging process or both. Note: a lot of the current work in this area is focused on the scaling aspect of reinforcement learning i.e. creating a guiding document and taking the human out of the loop. This might not be our consern in the therapy bot realm.
